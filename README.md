# Hand Gesture Detection

This project uses OpenCV and MediaPipe to detect and draw hand landmarks in real-time via a connected webcam. The script calculates the frame rate (FPS) and shows the camera resolution on the output window.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe

You can install the required dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe
